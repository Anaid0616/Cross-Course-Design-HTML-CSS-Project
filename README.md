A responsive, accessible, and interactive online store for gaming products, built as part of my Front-End Development (FED1) course at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

## **Description**
This project is part of a series of assignments focusing on different aspects of front-end development, including Design, HTML & CSS, and JavaScript. The website is built for a fictional client GameHub, an online shop where users can browse, view, and purchase a variety of computer games. The goal was to create a responsive and interactive site with a focus on best coding practices and accessibility standards.
