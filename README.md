A responsive, accessible, and interactive online store for gaming products, built as part of my Front-End Development (FED1) course at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.


## **Description**
This project is part of a series of assignments focusing on different aspects of front-end development, including Design, HTML & CSS, and JavaScript. The website is built for a fictional client GameHub, an online shop where users can browse, view, and purchase a variety of computer games. The goal was to create a responsive and interactive site with a focus on best coding practices and accessibility standards.


## **Project Goals**
***Design an Interactive Prototype:*** Using Figma to create a high-fidelity design for the website.

**Develop a Responsive and Accessible Site:** Implementing the design using semantic HTML and modular CSS.

**Integrate JavaScript for Dynamic Interactions:** Fetch data from an API, display products, and create a working shopping cart and checkout system.


## **Key Features**
**Product Listing:** Display a list of products on the homepage.

**Filtering Options:** Filter products by category, gender, or genre.

**Product Details:** View more information about a specific product on its own page.

**Shopping Basket:** Add and remove products from a cart.

**Order Summary and Checkout:** View cart contents and proceed to checkout.

**Confirmation Page:** Display an order confirmation after completing a purchase.
